>When we talk about units in CSS grid, we are also including the rows.
We have the following units: (NOTE** unit 5 and 6 are RESPONSIVE!!)
1. px
2. rem
3. em
4. %
5. auto  - responsive 
Example:  grid-template-columns: 200px 7rem auto;



6. fr - MOST USED, Responsive


                                                   Grid-template rows

 property name w/example:  grid-template-rows: 300px 20rem;                                               



                                                    fr-units

fraction of available space.
1fr is 1 fraction of the entire space, so basically you end up using the entire space 100% of it 
1fr 1fr means you have 2 fractions each taking 100%/2fr = 50% of the space avaliable in the column or row
2fr 1fr in regards to columns, means you will use 2fr for the first column and 1fr for the 2nd column



                                                    Gap property


1.grid-gap: 50px; means that the gap for BOTH the row and column of the grid is 50px
2.grid-gap: 50px 10px; means that the 1st value (50%) represents the row gap and 2nd value (10%) is for the column gap
3.grid-column-gap: 50px; means that only the gap only for the column of the grid is 50px;
4.grid-row-gap: 50px; means that only the gap for the row of the grid is 50px;
5.gap: 90px 10px;   this means that you have 90px gap for the rows and 10px gap in between the columns
